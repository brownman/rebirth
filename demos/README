  This directory contains demos of features, both existing and planned.
  These demos are used as a milestone for each feature release, to
  demonstrate that the feature is implemented.
  
  They are not examples to learn from. They are not recommendations for
  programming style. They're just internal test demos.
  
  Cheers,
   The Management.
